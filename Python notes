"""
    Python is formally an interpreted language. Commands are executed through a piece of software known as Python interpreter. The
    interpreter receives a command, evaluate that command, and reports the result of the command. The interpreter starts in interactive
    mode with a clean workspace. Commands from a predefined script saved om a file (e.g., demo.py) are executed by invoking the
    interpreter with the filename as an argument.

    Many integrated development environments (IDEs) provide richer software development platforms for Python, including one named IDLE
    that is included with the standard Python distribution.
