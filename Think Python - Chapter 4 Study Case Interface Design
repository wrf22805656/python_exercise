# 4.3 Exercises
# question one
from swampy.TurtleWorld import *
world = TurtleWorld()
turtle = Turtle()

def square(t):
    for i in range(4):
        fd(t, 200)
        rt(t)

square(turtle)

# question two
# add another parameter, named length to square, Modify the body
# so length of the sides is length, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument
# run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for length.


from swampy.TurtleWorld import *
world = TurtleWorld()
turtle = Turtle()
length = 150

def square(t, length):
    for i in range(4):
        fd(t, length)
        rt(t)

square(turtle,length)
wait_for_user()

# 4.5 Generalization
# the next step is to add a length parameter to square. Here is a solution:

from swampy.TurtleWorld import *
world = TurtleWorld()
turtle = Turtle()
length = 70

def polygon(t,n, length):
    angle = 360.0/n
    for i in range(n):
        fd(t, length)
        lt(t, angle)

polygon(turtle,12, length)
